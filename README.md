# Lux

An open source marketing website built using the new server components and everything else new in Next.js 13.

> **Warning**
> This site is a work in progress, being built in public. You can follow the progress on Twitter [@andynbrooker](https://twitter.com/andynbrooker).
> I validated the usefulness of the idea in public, with a preview of the hero section and it got a lot of engagement, so this project aims to continue the work.

The demo version of the site can be found [here](https://lux-andybrooker.vercel.app).

The marketing page aims to move away from the current trend of dark mode / purple websites, with a light mode marketing page feeling more suitable for a luxury (albeit non-existent) credit card company.
